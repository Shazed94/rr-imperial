              At our DSIR (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research)
              recognized R&D centers for RR Imperial Electricals Limited, we
              design, develop, assess and prove the cable behavior and
              functionality for the harshest environment and application. To
              achieve maximum realistic conditions, we simulate physical,
              chemical, environmental and electrical hazards on the cables. With
              our advanced set up we help mitigate any threat in an unusual
              application of our customer. No matter whether the cable is
              installed at -50Â°C or immersed in oil, our experts provide a
              reliable and sustainable solution, meeting advanced technological
              requirements at optimum cost.
